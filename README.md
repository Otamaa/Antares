# Antares
Antares is a WIP open-source reimplementation of newer closed-source [Ares](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Ares) versions. This project exists because source code of versions past 0.A are kept private, which means they can't be fixed and Ares can't be contributed to. The aim of that project is to reimplement those and keep it open-source so people can contribute to it.
